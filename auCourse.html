        <p>This section will be about the reviews of the courses that I have taken, these are only a few courses that I take out, there are more and more than these. There are some good and bad experiences that I met in these classes, but anyway, here they are.</p>

                    <p>Lecturer: Asst. Prof. Dr. Vasa Buraphadeja</p>
                </div>
                <p class="course-review-content">This was my first programming course, we studied python and learn about algorithms and different types of data structures. It was an easy-going class, I had a really good time learning in this class, no pressure whatsoever. The teacher was very supportive! Other than those, I also made a few good friends in major that become my best friends nowadays. :)</p>

                </div>
                <p class="course-review-content">This is one of the greatest course I have taken in this university! This was actually where I learned the most about coding. Throughout the support from Dr. Anan, I was never afraid to make mistakes and was able to improve my coding skill by a lot! The pace of classes went pretty fast, someone was not able to catch up if not doing any reviews after/before the classes. But I can ensure that you will be able to improve coding skill by a lot after finishing this!</p>

                </div>
                <p class="course-review-content">This class is easy-going but it was one of the class I learned the most. I learn to do data anaylsis, do some pattern finding on a large dataset. I got to know how to present data to the audience effectively. We learned to analyze data in excel and visualize data using easy tool like powerpoint. Good course with a great teacher!</p>

                </div>
                <p class="course-review-content">This is a great class with a great teacher. A. Swati is quite a strict person but that is what the good thing! From this class, we primarily learned to analyze business problems and functional requirements to solve the problems, doing the data flow diagrams, and most importantly, my documentation skill improved tremendously after finishing a big project report.</p>

                </div>
                <p class="course-review-content">This class was quite stressful for me. The class primarily is about learning formal English. We got to learn doing research essays for most of the time. The difficult parts in this course are understanding technical or formal vocabs, as well as speaking and listening. Almost didn't get an A, but I made it. :)</p>

                </div>
                <p class="course-review-content">I chosed table tennis as the main activity for the physical education class. This class was not well-organized and I didn't really learn a thing from this class and the fact that teacher was not able to speak English make the class worse. The only good thing from this class is that I got to know a few new friends.</p>
