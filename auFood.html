            <p class="au-food-review-detail"><b>Jippy House</b> is one most popular restaurant in Assumption University. It might be the restaurant that lasts the longest AU Mall. The dishes in this restaurant are very pleasing, the restaurant is well-organized, good service-minded staff, and short waiting time. However, the prices in this restaurant are quite too high for me, but it is understandable as dishes are quite big, which is not suitable for a non-eater like me. Anyway, overall is quite good.</p>

            <p class="au-food-review-detail">The overall of this <b>IM FiN FiN</b> restaurant is good, the prices are reasonable, but the waiting time is quite a bit too long. Sometimes if there are many people, it could take up to 40 minutes to serve. The tastes of dishes are pretty decent, most of the menus are okay. What I dislike is that sometimes there are arguements between staff and owners in the restaurant, but when it comes to servicing, staffs are very polite. Prices are also reasonable.</p>

Even though it is not very clean here, but there are variety of foods you can choose and most importantly, they are much cheaper than the other restaurants, you can keep your budget for any other things else. AU Cafeteria is located in both 1st floor and 2nd floor of AU Mall, which there are different kinds of restaurants available.Before going there, you need to exchange your money to money tickets to buy dishes in the cafeteria at the front desk.</p>
